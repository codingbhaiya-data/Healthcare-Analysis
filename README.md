#### Introduction
Apollo Hospitals, a premier healthcare provider in India, is renowned for its comprehensive healthcare services and state-of-the-art facilities. To maintain its leadership in the healthcare industry, Apollo Hospitals continually evaluates its financial and operational performance. This project aims to develop a dashboard that provides detailed insights into various financial and clinical metrics, enabling Apollo Hospitals to make data-driven decisions to enhance patient care and operational efficiency.

#### Objectives
The main objectives of the Apollo Hospitals Analysis Dashboard are:
1. **Financial Analysis:** To monitor and analyze key financial metrics such as billing amounts, medication costs, treatment costs, insurance coverage, room charges, and out-of-pocket expenses.
2. **Departmental Performance:** To evaluate the billing performance of different departments, identifying high and low revenue-generating areas.
3. **Geographic Distribution:** To visualize the distribution of healthcare services and financial metrics across different regions of India, understanding regional trends and patterns.
4. **Service Type and Diagnosis Analysis:** To assess billing amounts based on various diagnoses and service types (emergency, inpatient, outpatient), providing insights into healthcare utilization and cost distribution.
5. **Procedure-wise Analysis:** To analyze the financial impact of different medical procedures, highlighting the most and least profitable procedures.
